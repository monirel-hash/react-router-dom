# react-router-dom

The <Route> component defines a relationship (mapping) between a URL and a Component. This means that when the user visits a URL on the browser,
a corresponding Component must be rendered on the interface.
The exact attribute is used in the <Route> in order to say that this <Route> only works if the URL on the browser absolutely matches the value of its path attribute.
